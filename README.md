# Food-Generator
An Algorithm that randomly chooses a meal set for an individual per day
In this game, it's actually a beginners project, python developers can play with.
The idea of the game is just to randomly select a good diet for any individual,
in my source code my food list is actually limited, in yours you can create a larger list to choose form.
There is also a part of the source code that ensures the individual dosen't eat exactly same thing two times a day.
